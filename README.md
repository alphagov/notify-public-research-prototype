# GOV.UK Notify public research prototype

This project is for doing user research around emails and text messages.
It implements prototypes which are copies of real pages and services on
[GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk), with added email/text message flows and
call to actions, powered by the GOV.UK Notify API.

Based on: [webchat-prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/webchat-alpha)

## Building and running

This is based on the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit),
so most instructions that apply to that work here too. In short:

```bash
npm i
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
