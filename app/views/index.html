      <h1 class="b f2 f1-l mv4">Webchat alpha prototype</h1>
      <h2 class="b f3 mv3">What's this?</h2>
      <p>This is a prototype implementation of a webchat client. It was created for carrying out user research for the GDS alpha project looking at webchat.</p>
      <p>The source code for this is <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/webchat-alpha" target="_blank" rel="external">on GitHub</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="b f3 mv3">Instructions</h2>
      <p>This works best with two devices, or you can use two browser windows.</p>
      <p>Open the agent interface and follow the instructions by picking your adviser and writing an optional welcome message. Then click the "Start the chat" button. </p>
      <p>In the service prototype, find and click the webchat call to action. Type in your name, and you'll be taken to the queue.</p>
      <p>The agent interface will now give you an option to advance the queue, manually. Click 10 times to reach the conversation.</p>
      <p>When you're ready to end the conversation, the agent can do it in one click, or the user can also do it by using the top right "end chat" button.</p>
      <h2 class="b f3 mv3">Try chatting</h2>
      <h3 class="b f4 mv3">1. Open the agent interface</h3>

      <h3 class="b f4 mv3">2. Open a service</h3>
      <p>
        We were testing use of webchat with users in Goverment services.<br>
        These are not real screens from real services: they helped get the user thinking about a task, instead of webchat or support.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/pay-dartford-crossing-charge">Pay Dartford crossing charge prototype</a><br>
        The task was to pay for using the crossing today.<br>
        The prototype does not validate any of the information.<br>
        This will always fail to submit the payment.<br>
        The webchat call to action is in the footer of all pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/state-pension-age">State pension prototype</a><br>
        The task was to get a state pension forecast.<br>
        As a part of this, we made users find their National Insurance number.<br>
        Validates typing anything at all into the National Insurance number field. Stops at the postcode page.<br>
        The webchat call to action is in the "I cannot find my National Insurance number" section.
      </p>
      <h2 class="b f3 mv3">Warning!</h2>
      <p>This is a prototype built for the sole purpose of user testing in a lab. It is not exhaustively tested on all browsers. The browsers we used were Chrome for macOS and Windows, Safari on iOS 9, and Chrome for Android.</p>
      <p>The prototype does not work with more than one user and one agent at a time. If someone else is using this prototype, you will see their chats or it may not work properly. You can have more than one chat in a row, but every chat needs to end before a new one can begin. If you manage to break it and desync the agent/user, refresh both starting with the agent and start over.</p>
      <p>If you're chatting as a user and you accidentally refresh the interface, you'll resume where you left off. If you refresh as an agent, you'll become desynced and you'll have to start over.</p>
